## Implementation

Created a few components for individual elements of the widget:
* ReviewWidget: the container for the widget itself
* StarsBar: the top component, containing the five total stars, with the overall average rating being filled in for an easy visual representation
* Rating bar: the component for the five bars at the botttom, containing the number of stars, the bar (filled to represent the amount of reviews for that level), and the total number of reviews for that particular rating.


## Testing

Unfortunately did not have the time to implement any tests for this yet.
